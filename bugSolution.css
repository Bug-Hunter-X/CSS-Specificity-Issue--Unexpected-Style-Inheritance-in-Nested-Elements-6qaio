The solution focuses on understanding CSS specificity and adjusting selectors to avoid unexpected overrides:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myElement {
  color: green;
}

#myElement.container {
  color: purple; /* Ensure that parent element style is not overwritten */
}

#myElement.container div {
  color: yellow;
}
```

To resolve the issue, ensure that the specificity of selectors accurately reflects the desired style inheritance.  In this case, the most specific selector (`#myElement.container div`) correctly applies the `yellow` color to the inner `div` elements. You may consider using the `!important` flag only as a last resort and only if the source of the problem is outside your control, and only on styles that do not require any overriding by more specific styles.
