The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and how it can unexpectedly override styles:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myElement {
  color: green;
}

#myElement.container {
  color: purple;
}

#myElement.container div {
  color: yellow;
}
```

This code defines several selectors with increasing specificity:

1. `div`: A universal selector for all div elements.
2. `.container div`: A class selector targeting div elements within an element with class `container`.
3. `#myElement`: An ID selector for an element with the ID `myElement`.
4. `#myElement.container`: An ID and class selector targeting an element with both the ID `myElement` and the class `container`.
5. `#myElement.container div`: A very specific selector targeting div elements within an element with both the ID `myElement` and the class `container`.

The issue lies in the way specificity is calculated in CSS.  When an element matches multiple selectors, the most specific selector determines the final styling. Because of the high specificity of `#myElement.container div`, even if the parent's color is set to yellow, the div elements within it might still inherit the color from another, more specific selector.  This results in unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with nested elements.

The unexpected behavior could be that a `div` element inside `#myElement.container` might not inherit the color `yellow` as expected, instead taking a color from a less specific rule.
